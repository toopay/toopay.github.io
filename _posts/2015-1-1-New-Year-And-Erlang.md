title: New Year, Erlang Way...
---

Its not a coincident that this, my first blog post, was written in the very beginning of 2015. Last year i was massively busy, mainly developing several apps for [SaaSVentures](http://saasventures.co), and barely can't have luxury time for writing. 

Since i have two days for new year frenzied, i think its maybe a good time to start rolling this blog as place for me to put things i want to remember.

## Why Erlang?

There is a little girl. She's 1 year old. And this morning, when she wake up, she saw a thing, which was latter become her favourite amongst other stuff in her naive childhoold life. She never see this item before, even adults around her use it in daily basis without her being noticed. There is a light spread out from this small item, which projecting many images. And surprisingly, it also generate many different sounds too. She was amazed, and reach it eagerly to investigate. It was her parent smartphone, that apparently her mom forgot to keep it safely last night.

My first encounter with Erlang was pretty much the same story.
