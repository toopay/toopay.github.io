title: New Year, Erlang Way...
---

Its not a coincident that this, my first blog post, was written in the very beginning of this year. Last year i was massively busy, mainly developing several apps for [SaaSVentures](http://saasventures.co), and barely can't have luxury time for writing. 

Since i have two days for new year frenzied, i think its maybe a good time to start rolling this blog as place for me to put things i want to remember.
