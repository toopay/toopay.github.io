title: New Year, Erlang Way...
---

Its not a coincident that this, my first blog post, was written in the very beginning of 2015. Last year i was massively busy, mainly developing several apps for [SaaSVentures](http://saasventures.co), and barely can't have luxury time for writing. 

Since i have two days for new year frenzied, i think its maybe a good time to start rolling this blog as place for me to put things i want to remember.

## Why Erlang?

There is a little girl. She's one year old. And this morning, when she wake up, she saw a thing, which was latter become her favourite amongst other stuff in her naive childhoold life. She never see this item before, even adults around her use it in daily basis without her being noticed. There is a light - so many lights, go around this small item, which projecting many images. And surprisingly, it also generate many different sounds too. She was amazed, and reach it eagerly to investigate. It was her parent smartphone, that apparently her mom forgot to keep it safely last night. Her life is never be the same ever since then.

My first encounter with Erlang was pretty much the same story. As for today, i already wrote roughly 3K LOC of Erlang, building my first OTP application, yet, this Excelent (with big "E") platform still surprised me in the way that none of my previous programming language(s) did! There are several key points i'm about to share, in my very beginning journey of Erlang world.

## Its an easy to learn language!

First and foremost, i'm easy to get bored by tedious things. I prefer practice over theory, and simplicity over monolithic stuff. If i must added here, instead a collection of Mozart symfony, i only have Coldplay on my Soundcloud playlist.

Same thing applied to my programming life. I'm not interested with [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) and i hate [Java](https://www.facebook.com/frei.denken/posts/10203180194450253). I'm avoid any platform that both requires me to think hard on figuring out the language construct and make it difficult for me to finding right keyword from its grammar specification. 

So we may start with a simple question, how many keywords that Erlang have?

```
after apply attributes call case
catch do end fun in
let letrec module of primop
receive try when
```

There are only 18 keywords! Good sign.
